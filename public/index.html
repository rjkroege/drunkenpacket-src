        <p>Some of you may remember 1984.  Not the movie but Macintosh.  As far as a computer geeks go,
that was the event in the year.  It took a while for me to touch the machine personally.  I still remember
the moment.  I was a poor college student living in Tokyo back then.</p>
<p>In an afternoon of the day, I stopped by a showroom of a major computer dealer in Tokyo downtown 
(precisely say, Takatano Baba).  It was sitting quietly without drawing much attention from visitors.
It had to be a dream machine, since that was conceived by two Steves of Apple (well, I believed that 
way at the moment).  Once I started playing with the machine, it was breathtaking.  I could not believe 
how far the machine gone to.  I felt like I had been living in a dark age.  And this was the light for the 
future.</p>
<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/lSiQA6KKyJo&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/lSiQA6KKyJo&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>

<p>Macintosh has created our future in some sense.  On the other hand, Macintosh is currently neither 
dominating PC market nor anything closer.  Microsoft launched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_1.0">Windows ver 1.0</a> in 1985.<br>The product was not anywhere near Macintosh.  I could not believe how primitive it was.  It was like a 
small project done by a summer intern.  Around 1986, Macintosh sales were taking off.  Apple had a 
great success.  Many had believed that Apple would enjoy the success long time.</p>
<p>Microsoft launched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.0">Windows ver 3</a> in 1990 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x">ver 3.1</a> in 1992.  Macintosh was still 
technically ahead of them.  However, Microsoft was seeing a strong sales growth as they were persistent.
Then, Microsoft released <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95">Windows 95</a> in 1995.  It was the time that Netscape (founded in 1994) 
was changing the world by introducing the web to the world.  Windows 95 sales took off with a huge 
demand for Internet terminal.  Windows 95 was the choice for most.  Apple had gradually lost their sales.<br>They had a major business crisis in 1997.  Though they could have died then, Steve Jobs comes back and 
miraclously they have survived.</p>
<p>In 2007 Apple has released iPhone.  The iPhone has been sold in a brisk pace.  As several experts points
out, this is not yet another cell phone.  This is an another breakthrough.  Cell phones have been around
for a while.  Gradually we realized that this could be a great computing device.  Some attempts were
made without much success.  It seems that the iPhone is changing the picture.  Ok, the sales is pretty
good.  But what does make it a breakthrough?</p>
<p>Apple introduced iPhone 3G this month.  Simultaneously it has released version 2.0 firmware that allows 
developers to write code for the device officially.  This year&#39;s WWDC (Apple&#39;s developer&#39;s conference) 
had a record number of developers (sold out first time ever since 1983 when a first WWDC was held in 
Monterey, CA).  Obviously many new developers were drawn by iPhone.  For whatever reason, many 
developers want to do their business on it.  That is very critical for a platform business.  I think this is
one good indication for their success.  I have not seen any other mobile phone attracting this many
application developers.</p>
<p>Maybe Apple has made an another major leap by iPhone.  The ambience around the device reminds me 
1984.  That is very exciting.  On the other hand, we know the rest of the history.  I have to wonder what 
we are going to remember in ten years.  I strongly hope that &quot;2007 won&#39;t be like 1984&quot;.  Still they are
not the only player in town.  I am going to write some interesting observations of the mobile computing
platform later.</p>

yellowing newspaper stumbling across a deserted alleyway. The paper
billows beyond a veil of steam and the noises of the awakening city
clink through the fog. The dawn is arriving.</p>
