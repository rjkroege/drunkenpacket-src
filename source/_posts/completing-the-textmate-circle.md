<div class='post_body'><p>In a previous post, I muttered about making Code Search queries from
TextMate. In this post, I present the other side: opening Code Search
results in TextMate. This <a href="http://drunkenpacket.com.s3.amazonaws.com/files/txtmtcs.crx">Chrome extension</a>
will, once you
configure the path to where you&rsquo;ve put your Chromium source tree (the
options page sets this), augment the line numbers in Code Search
results with TextMate URLs. Click the line number to have TextMate
open the file at the desired line.</p>

<p>Source is forthcoming. On GitHub probably.</p>
