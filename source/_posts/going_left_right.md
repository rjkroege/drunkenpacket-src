title: Going Left or Going Right

Background
=========
Some time ago at work, I had the occasion to move offices. There
were a number of reasons for this.  However, the reason is not
particularly germane. Here, we are concerned with a much more
important issue: the new route to the breakroom.

There are now two paths to the breakroom.  The choice is agonizing.
Do I want to go left or right? The routes seem almost the same
length.  There are no coworkers whose presence necessitate one
particular route.   (As an aside, this is not unprecedented.  At a
previous employer, the presence of a single software development
intern with the combination of a flirtatious demeanor and a marked
resemblance to a young [Patsy Kensit][pk] forced the imposition of a
star topology on the office halls with the hub immediately outside
her office.  But I digress.)

Obviously I need to add some empiricism to my life and determine
the shortest route as laziness reigns supreme.  (Some would euphemize
laziness as *optimization* or *efficiency*.)  (Perhaps I could even 
persuade my manager of this?)

My solution: count steps going left and going right, compute a
two-tail null test (Student's T-test) on them to see if they represent
different means and report the result.

Data

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Right</b></td>
		<td><b>Left</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>67</td>
		<td>80</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>66</td>
		<td>76</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>65</td>
		<td>77</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>64</td>
		<td>79</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Long Tangent
==========

So, this was not so simple.  Not for me was to get out my trusty
HP calculator and do the necessary math.  I couldn't even choose
to write some simple code. Instead, I decided that would install a
nice statistics package and do simple statistics with *style*.

So, I embarked on a long painful journey:

1.	I set up [ASDF][ASDF] and [ASDF-install][ASDF install].
	(Yes, I must do statistics in LISP.  The packet lithps when
	drunk.)  Take-away: the [ASDF-install tutorial][ASDF install tutorial] was very
	helpful but didn't really address the whole [gpg][gpg] integration
	issue. And restarts in [OpenMCL][OpenMCL] are confusing for the
	neophyte.


2.	I installed [cl-mathstats][cl mathstats].  This is a package that appears
	under the hood to be a bit of Frankenstein: lots of pieces
	from different places.  And the docs don't actually help
	me very much but then perhaps I am simply silly. (In a
	perfect world, I would offer some patches against [TINAA][TINAA]
	that have a different CSS aesthetic.)


At last, I was ready to do some statistics in style:


	( import 'cl-mathstats:mean )
	( import 'cl-mathstats:variance )
	( import 'cl-mathstats:data-length )
	( import 'cl-mathstats:students-t-significance )
	
	( defun left-or-right ( right-v left-v ) 
		"uses statistical tools from cl-mathstats to do
		with style what I should have done with a pencil:
		perform a two-tail null hypothesis test comparing
		right-v and left-v.

		returns the probability that the normally distributed
		populations from which samples right-v, left-v are
		drawn have different means."
		( let
			(( sv  ( /  
				( abs ( -  (mean right-v ) ( mean left-v )))
				( sqrt  ( + 
					( / ( variance right-v  ) ( length right-v ))
					( / ( variance left-v ) ( length left-v ))))))
			( dof 
				( + ( length right-v )  ( length left-v ) -2 )))
				
				( students-t-significance sv dof :both )))

	( left-or-right  '(   67 66 65 64  ) '(   80 76 77 79 ) )


Result
=====

Ah ha!  To a 0.9999 significance level, going right and left differ!
Wow. So much effort to save 12 whole steps by going right, albeit
at least three times a day. I am *so* efficient. I have optimized
my life further. Soon, I will only travel under rainbows and wear
a woven bamboo hat.
