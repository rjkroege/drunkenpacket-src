It's been a while. The packet has been distracted with life. I suppose
that will get discussed in future articles. So we are trying something
*new*. Largely because the old way was technically neat and all but
required us to spend more time developing blogging tools than actually
updating the blog. And so there are a lot of unfinished CLs for the
blog tools but no actual new blog entries. So, a new way: less
friction. Easier adding.
