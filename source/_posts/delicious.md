It has penetrated the packet's WebKit-induced mental torpidity that
delicious will be going away. Ack. How will I have manage my enormous
collection of semi-useful bookmarks. (A large and growing collection
of digital cruft which are a meta-level equivalence to many of my
books. Links to knowledge are equivalent to having the knowledge
right? But never the mind. Back to the topic at hand. How to manage
bookmarks now.)

I have read [redmonk's](http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2010/03/05/del-icio-us-pinboard/) opinion
and have no idea how to proceed. I at least have ideas.

*  I could build a bookmark archive using posterous itself. YASP!
*  [diigo]("http://www.diigo.com/) Except that it looks heavy.
*  [pinboard](http://pinboard.in/switch/) except that maybe I don't
want to pay.  This looks like the best choice but I don't think that
it syncs with Chrome.
*  [bredcrums](http://www.bredcrums.com/) but they don't spell
*crumb* or *bred* correctly and and the flash makes me hostile. Which
are silly reasons but at least you're getting an insight into my
decision process.

Grumble. At least we don't work at yahoo.
