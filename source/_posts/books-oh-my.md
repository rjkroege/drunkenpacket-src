<div class='post_body'>Friends have leant me an assortment of books. I have nice friends. They have diverse interests.  I've been reading them slowly. Some comments about them are in order. <p>First finished book: World War Z. I would pronounce the last letter zed though I suppose the name has more humour as zee rhyming with three. What a strange saga. The zombies need a why. In particular how they resist rotting. Still, I was entertained.</p></div>
