<div class='post_body'><p>Hello gentle readers. I have finished the first version of my Chrome extension for posting <a href="http://pinboard.in">pinboard.in</a> bookrmarks from the Chrome omnibox. The general idea is that, with the extension installed, you can type <code>+pin hardware Buy a new computer</code> to record a bookmark for the current page with the tag <code>hardware</code> and the note <code>Buy a new computer</code>.</p>

<p>You can get it at <a href="https://github.com/rjkroege/pinboardExtensions">github</a>. I&rsquo;ll package it up soon and then brave the process for submission to the extensions archive.</p></div>
