<div class='post_body'><p>Oh devoted readers, you will recall from earlier that I was bemoaning the possible end of delicious. And my waxing cassandra on the matter. Eventually, I decided to use Google bookmarks. I have revisited my choices. I was finding Google bookmarks tedious. Besides, I wanted something different. So, I have done what I should have done in the first place and am now using <a href="pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>.</p>

<p>This has required some integration with my web-browsing work-flow. (I shudder at the thought of calling it <em>work-flow</em> given that it is largely web-browsing born out of the stultifying boredom of being confined to bed. But <em>idle-flow</em> doesn&rsquo;t really have the same familiar ring.) I have applied the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geojpngopndpffccbfgekncdgmgchmgh">Pinboard.in Chrome button</a> to make it easy to add bookmarks. (I tried some others but this one worked the best for me.)</p></li>
<li><p>Searching my pinboard bookmarks from the Chrome omnibox as per <a href="http://blog.justin.kelly.org.au/how-to-add-pinboardin-search-mine-as-a-chrome">Add Pinboard to &lsquo;Search Mine&rsquo;</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>But this leaves two issues which I&rsquo;d like to rectify:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add a bookmark from the omnibox via command. I can type the name of the bookmarklet but it requires an extra keystroke (down arrow) for Chrome to not try searching for the bookmarklet name on Google. The extra keystroke is clearly too much effort for flowing idly.</p></li>
<li><p>Slurp the pinboard bookmarks into Chrome&rsquo;s bookmarks automatically so that omnibox searches go to the pinboard bookmarks too.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For both of these, I think I will need to write Chrome extensions. You should anticipate these also appearing on my github once I think they actually work.</p></div>
