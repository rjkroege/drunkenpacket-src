It has become a bit of a recurring meme to take photos of food. Many
times, food is indeed plated in a fashion that is at least creative if
not actual art.

This begs the question: what makes for photogenic food? The steam? The
color? Does comfort food look better or worse than la nouvelle
cuisine? Inquiring minds want to know.
