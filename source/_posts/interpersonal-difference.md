<div class='post_body'>The packet has over the last few weeks been busy trying to meet a work-related milestone. It would be mildly therapeutic to rant about the challenges of our schedule but this would be both indiscreet and tedious.     <p>Consequently, any non-work time has been spent with friends instead of more terminal time to blog or debug. (Note how the chrome plugin has not received any maintenance.) </p><p>In this time, the packet has become aware of an aspect of human behavior which differs hugely between his friends: their respective acceptance (or even enjoyment) of off-colour humor. The existence of such a variation is not that surprising. But  its magnitude does.</p><p>Like all such musings, this one too has an associated yasp: how can one test for such a thing, quantify its intensity and correlate it with other personality aspects?</p><p>The packet must now peruse the psychology literature.</p></div>
